    <h1>World Cup News</h1>
    <p>
        The biggest scoreline in the history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of
        international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.

        This legendary match also brought global renown for <i>Archie Thompson</i>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world
        record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.

        And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been
        that is now the subject of and acclaimed documentary, <i>'Next Goal Wins'</i>, showing across the world.
