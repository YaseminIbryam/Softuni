    <h1>The making off a css font</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">how it wors</h2>
    <p>
        This is a hybrid of web and font design. Each character is built like any web element and
        used inline to behave like a font. Metrics, Weights, OpenType Features and all the other
        font properties are controlled exclusively with the CSS file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The font design is based on the border width of the elements, which makes it extremely
        versatile. With the exemption of script fonts, several styles and weights can result just
        from border variations, using the same shape. On more complex characters the clip-
        path and tha background is used to create the cutout effect.
