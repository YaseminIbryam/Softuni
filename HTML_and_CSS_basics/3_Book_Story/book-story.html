    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>
    Molly had been staring out of her window for about an
    hour now. On her dest, lying between the copies of
    <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific
    journals her work had appeared in, was well thumbed
    copy of <i>On The Road</i>. It had been Molly's favourite
    book since college, and the longer she spent in these
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting
        under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming
        that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing
        better to do"
